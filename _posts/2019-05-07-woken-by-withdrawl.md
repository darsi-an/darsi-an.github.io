## Woken by Withdrawal

---

Up at 3am  
I begin my day early  
To thoughts of failure  
and death.  

Up at 3am  
On my balcony  
I light a cigarette  
Mind still as the night  
Thoughts fluid  
Like water  
They take any form.  

Up at 3am  
I take a drag and ponder  
How shall I waste this time   
Wish upon a star or satellite  
Illuminated by the moon  
For something I want far more  
Than love and happiness  

Up at 3am  
I seek  
The red carpet to my conscience   
I find it  

Over the first morning smoke  
In a pot of fresh roasted coffee   
Spiked with 2 cups Amarula    
An omelet of stimulants, The Potion.  

I was woken by withdrawal  
Up at 3am
